<section id="about">
  <p>
    <span class="ff">Ferris Fencing</span>
    is a live tournament in which player-programmed bots combat each other on a
    RISC-V virtual machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a showcase of
    <a href="https://www.github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm">CKB-VM</a>,
    a simple implementation of the RISC-V instruction set,
    written in the
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>
    programming language.

  <h2>The Rules</h2>

  <p>
    Matches are contested between two fencers, each named Ferris, and each
    running in their own VM.
  </p>

  <p>The fencers square off on a two-dimensional grid 10 spaces wide.</p>

  <p>Each match consists of 5 games. The player to win the most games wins the match.</p>

  <p>
    Games consist of up to 20 turns. Each turn, Ferris may move forward one space,
    backward one space, stand in place, or lunge two spaces toward the opponent.
  </p>

  <p>
    A game is won by lunging and landing on the spame space as the opponent
    lands. Beware though &mdash; a lunge can be countered, and the game won, by
    stepping backward into an opposing lunge, parying it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Otherwise, colliding fencers repel each other proportionate to the relative
    strength of their moves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fencers have limited energy (CPU cycles) per game, and in the event of a tie,
    the fencer with the most remaining energy wins.
